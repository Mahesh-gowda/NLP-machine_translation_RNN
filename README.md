# NLP-machine_translation_RNN
in this project RNN method is used for translation 


Introduction
building a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. the completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation.

Preprocess - You'll convert text to sequence of integers.
Models Create models which accepts a sequence of integers as input and returns a probability distribution over possible translations. 
Prediction Run the model on English text.
